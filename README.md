# CaHoSa (Care Home Safety) AI — Predictive Safety Intelligence for Care Environments

## Overview

CaHoSa AI is a predictive safety intelligence platform designed to transform reactive compliance processes into proactive risk detection and prevention across care environments.

The platform integrates risk analytics, Infection Prevention & Control (IPC) modelling, and AI-assisted decision support to help identify emerging safety risks before incidents occur.

Built from frontline IPC practice and insight from advanced microbiology training. CaHoSa AI aims to improve safety outcomes across care homes and related healthcare environments.



## The Problem

Many care environments rely on retrospective reporting systems that:

- Document incidents after harm occurs.
- Provide limited predictive insight.
- Fragment safety and infection risk monitoring.
- Increase staff workload without improving early detection.

Existing systems primarily focus on documentation and compliance tracking rather than predictive safety intelligence, leaving a gap in early risk identification.



## The Solution

CaHoSa AI introduces predictive safety intelligence by combining:

- Risk analytics to detect patterns in safety indicators.
- Infection Prevention & Control modelling.
- AI-assisted decision support to guide proactive interventions.
- Domain-informed design grounded in microbiology and frontline care practice.



## Initial Focus

- Care homes and supported living environments.
- Patient safety and infection prevention.
- Decision support for operational risk management.



## Development Approach

Current phase:

- Conceptual architecture and modelling.
- Definition of risk intelligence framework.
- Documentation of domain-driven requirements.

Future phases:

- Prototype development.
- Predictive modelling implementation.
- User testing within care environments.



## Ethics, Safety, and Governance

CaHoSa AI is designed with:

- Clinical governance principles.
- Responsible AI considerations.
- Data privacy and ethical safety frameworks.



## Status

Early-stage development and concept validation.
